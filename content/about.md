## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

I am a biophysicistâ€”my initial training is in biology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics. After a [Ph.D. in cell biology](./thesis.pdf) in Toulouse (France), I was a postdoc in [Gary Brouhard laboratory](https://brouhardlab.mcgill.ca/) for four years at the University of McGill in Montreal (Canada).

In 2020, I join [InvivoAI](https://www.invivoai.com/) to work on computational infrastructure and perform research on small molecules and therapeutic targets. At InvivoAI, I apply cutting edge in silico data-based methods to predict molecule properties, explore the chemical space, and design new and synthesizable molecules.
