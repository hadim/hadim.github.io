I made my internship in 2011 at the [IMB](http://www.imb.uq.edu.au){:target="_blank"} at the University of Queensland in Australia in the [N. Hamilton group](http://www.imb.uq.edu.au/modelling-visualisation-and-classification-of-bio-imaging-nick-hamilton){:target="_blank"}.

I worked on two different subjects:

- High-throughput image analysis
- Branching morphogenesis in mouse kidney development
